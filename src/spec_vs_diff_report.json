However, several strict-text requirements are not met (exact hero copy and exact prefilled WhatsApp message), and at least one booking CTA/external calendar link appears to remain (Impact page). The diff also includes unrelated/unrequested work (favicons/favicon loader) and edits to an explicitly immutable hook file.",
