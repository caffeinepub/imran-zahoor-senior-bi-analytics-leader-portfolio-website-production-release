        "In frontend/src/pages/AboutPage.tsx, the spacing for the title/location block under the profile image is reduced (e.g., by lowering the margin-top and/or vertical gaps) without altering any text content.",
        "No font sizes, font weights, alignment, or grid/column structure are changed; only spacing-related Tailwind classes are modified.",
        "On both mobile and desktop breakpoints, the role title and location sit closer together and/or closer to the profile image compared to current behavior, reducing the perceived empty space in the left column.",
        "No regression to responsiveness: the layout remains centered and aligned as before across breakpoints."
